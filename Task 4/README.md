# Task 4: Optimizing Churn Prediction

## **Overview**

In this task, we aim to improve the churn prediction model by using advanced algorithms like **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**. The goal is to compare these models and determine which one performs the best in predicting customer churn at GlobalMart.

## **Steps Involved**

1. **Data Preprocessing**:

   * **Feature Scaling**: Used **StandardScaler** to scale numerical features.
   * **One-Hot Encoding**: Applied to categorical features.

2. **Model Training**:

   * Trained **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost** models.

3. **Evaluation**:

   * Evaluated models using **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-Score**, and **Confusion Matrix**.

4. **Comparison**:

   * **Logistic Regression** performed the best based on the **F1-Score**, making it the preferred model for deployment.

## **File Structure**

* **task4.ipynb**: Contains the code for training models, evaluating them, and comparing performance.
* **README.md**: This file.

## **Requirements**

* **Python 3.x**
* **Libraries**:

  * pandas
  * scikit-learn
  * xgboost
  * matplotlib
  * seaborn

Install the required libraries 
```

## **Conclusion**

The **Logistic Regression** model performed the best for predicting customer churn in this case and is selected for deployment at GlobalMart.
